= Building Sproxel =

The easiest way to build sproxel is to use Qt Creator. But here are minimal build instructions:

== Building on Linux ==

Install IlmBase from [http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html the OpenEXR project]. Unpack the archive and run:

{{{
./configure
make install
}}}

Install QT sdk from [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ Qt Download Page] if you don't already have it installed with your distro.

If you installed IlmBase in a non-standard location, make sure pkgconfig can find it. You may need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH. If you run:

{{{
pkg-config --cflags IlmBase
}}}

It should not give you an error.

Check out the sproxel code and run:
{{{
qmake
make
}}}

That should work.

== Building on Mac ==

Same as above. 

== Building on Windows ==

I haven't got a build on windows yet. If anyone manages to get it to build for windows let me know.
