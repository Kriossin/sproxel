==Mouse Controls==
The mouse controls the movement of the camera and the creation and manipulation of filled cells in the voxel grid.

*Camera Controls:*
The camera controls are identical to that in Autodesk's Maya.  Holding the *ALT* key drops the 3d view into camera control mode.

  * *ALT* + *LEFT MOUSE BUTTON* - Rotate the camera around its center of interest.
  * *ALT* + *MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON* - Translate the camera orthographic to its look direction.
  * *ALT* + *RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON* - Translate the camera towards its look point (feels like a scale).
  * *ALT* + *LEFT MOUSE BUTTON* + *MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON* - Scale (same as RMB).


====Cell Manipulation====
Cells are created by shooting a ray through the pixel you click, intersecting it with the voxel grid, and modifying the grid cells the ray intersects.

  * *LEFT MOUSE BUTTON* - Place a cell of the current color in the last grid cell the ray intersects before it hits another filled cell.  This can be thought of as shooting a wad of paint into the voxel grid.

  * *RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON* - Clear the color in the first colored cell the ray intersects.

  * *CTRL* + *LEFT MOUSE BUTTON* - Replace the first voxel the ray intersects  with the current color.

  * *CTRL* + *MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON* - Flood fill (paint bucket) the intersected voxel and its neighbors with the current color.

  * *CTRL* + *RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON* - Sample your current color (eye dropper) from the first voxel intersected.

  * *SHIFT* + *LEFT MOUSE BUTTON* - Fill an entire slice of the grid - WIP (only works horizontally for now).

==Keyboard Controls==
WIP: The quick-quick summary is that the holding *ALT* and using the *ARROW KEYS* moves the camera, the *ARROW KEYS* on their own move the cursor (it adjusts according to the direction your camera is facing), *CTRL* + *UP/DOWN ARROW* shifts the cursor in camera depth, and the *SPACE BAR* fills the voxel with the current color.
